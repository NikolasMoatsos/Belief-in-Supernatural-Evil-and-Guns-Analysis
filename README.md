This project was implemented during the course "Applied Machine Learning", offered by the Department of Management Science & Technology of the Athens University of Economics and Business.

## Purpose
The aim of this project is to replicate a study of belief in supernatural evil and attitudes towards guns in the United States. The study is:

Christopher G. Ellison, Benjamin Dowd-Arrow, Amy M. Burdette, Pablo E. Gonzalez, Margaret S. Kelley, Paul Froese, "Peace through superior firepower: Belief in supernatural evil and attitudes toward gun policy in the United States", Social Science Research, Volume 99, 2021, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssresearch.2021.102595.

The study tries to link the belief in supernatural evil with a range of gun policy attitudes, by testing theoretical arguments regarding this linkage.

## Data
The dataset is based on the responses of *The Wave Four of the Baylor Religion Survey (BRS)*, which was conducted in January of 2014. This survey took a random sample of 1572 non-institutionalized respondents with ages from 18 and over, who reside in the continental United States.

The dataset is stored in *The Association of Religion Data Archives (the ARDA)* and can be found [here](https://www.thearda.com/Archive/Files/Descriptions/BRS2014.asp).
